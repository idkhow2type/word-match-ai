# Word match AI

Algorithms that plays a Vietnamese playground game that can roughly be translated as "Word match"

The game can be played with 2 or more people, and roughly goes like this:
1. Choose a starting word
2. In every turn, the current player take the last syllable of the current word, and find a new word that starts with that syllable (For example: "xin chào" could be followed with "chào hỏi")
3. If the current player can't find a valid word, they are out of the game

This repository will contain various algorithms that attempts to choose the best word for each turn (sometimes with various restrictions)

Also sidenote: this project revealed that this game is actually incredibly boring.
